This is a mock website created by Jacob Schwartz for his ENGL 2010 class.
The current ASL website was out of date and in need of a replacement, but unfortunately Jacob didn't know how to make a website from scratch.
Luckily, he did know how to use GitHub and GitHub Pages, and thus with some more research and help from the minimal-mistakes Jekyll theme this mock website was born.
