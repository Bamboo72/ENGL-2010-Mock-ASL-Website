## What is Deaf culture?
Deaf culture is the unique culture of Deaf people. Keep in mind that's Deaf with a capital "D". Deaf culture is distinguished by the unique language, art, and behaviors of Deaf people. A great overview of Deaf culture is given in the book, "Introduction to American Deaf Culture". This book, written by Deaf author Thomas K. Holcomb, is a fantastic exploration of American Deaf culture and all it has to offer. The main focus of the book is how Deaf culture fits the definition of culture by having its own unique language, art, literature, customs, and people. Holcomb covers topics including  how American and Deaf culture contrast, how Deaf people feel about being called disabled, how Deaf art and literature reflect a unique perspective, and how Deaf culture has evolved over centuries of hardship due to optimistic Deaf individuals. Holcomb also doesn’t stray away from covering controversial and complex topics such as discrimination within the Deaf community; eugenics, hearing aids, and cochlear implants; and the necessity of hearing people’s assistance to build bridges between the Deaf and hearing worlds. This book contributes to my project by being a large source of my knowledge of Deaf culture, and by showcasing Deaf culture in multiple different perspectives. This book also includes several examples of Deaf art and poetry, and several anecdotes that demonstrate the unique existence of Deaf culture.

## How can you be more involved with Deaf culture?
[This article](https://www.startasl.com/deaf-community/) from Start ASL gives great information about Deaf culture and its different layers, as well as how people can become more involved with it.

In general though, just trying to communicate and become with Deaf people is a great way to become more involved with Deaf culture. Your current knowledge of ASL doesn't matter as long as you make the effort to be respectful of Deaf culture and to learn more.

## Cochlear implants
Cochlear implants are a rather complicated and controversial topic, but here's a brief overview:

### What are cochlear implants?
"A cochlear implant (CI) is a surgically implanted neuroprosthesis that provides a person who has who has bilateral moderate-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss with sound perception and improved speech understanding in both quiet and noise. The CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process by providing direct electrical stimulation to the auditory nerve. Through everyday listening and effective auditory training, both children and adults learn to interpret those signals as speech and sound, thus restoring functional hearing." and "Despite providing the ability for hearing and oral speech communication to children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss, there is also controversy around the devices. Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the Deaf community. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which as some view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority." - Wikipedia

Practically, cochlear implants are a way for individuals with hearing loss to "hear", but they're rather constroversial especially in the Deaf community for a variety of reasons.

### Aren't there positives of cochlear implants?
The National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management here at USU are in support of hearing aids and cochlear implants. They have a quote: "A child's ability to hear should not be determined based on family income. It should be viewed as a fundamental right to the citizens of our state, especially when we have a mandated hearing screening program. To diagnose deafness and then fail to provide intervention is morally and ethically unacceptable. We need to provide access to hearing aids via multiple sources (Medicaid and private insurances)." It seems like a good thing to provide deaf kids with a way to "hear", but the issue isn't that cut and dry. Shouldn't the kids have the choice whether to hear or not? Why should parents get to decide how a child will live for the rest of their life? Cochlear implants are a complex decision, so it's important to weigh both opitons, and that's why it's important that parents are aware of Deaf culture and the inclusion and opportunities it has for deaf and hard of hearing individuals.

### What does a Deaf scholar have to say about this?
A Deaf scholar, Dr. Chongmin Lee, wrote an academic article, in which he gives an outline of the ethical and practical problems with cochlear implants. He specifically goes into depth about different views on deafness, the nature and notion of deafness, and the purpose of Deaf education. Lee’s main argument isn’t necessarily that cochlear implants themselves are bad, but that they tend to not fix the whole problem, and that they isolate implanted individuals from the Deaf community.

> readers may wonder if I would want cochlear implants and, whether if I had a deaf child I would give him or her cochlear implants? My response is a categorical “No.” I know that my deafness can be a disadvantage in a majority-hearing society. As readers may suspect, I have struggled with personal and public issues secondary to my disability—I do not deny my physical disability. It is true that I can’t perceive sounds without hearing-assistance technology, and even with hearing aids or cochlear implants, I would still need an interpreter to facilitate communication with hearing individuals who do not know sign language. Yet I do not need to be perceived in a negative way: as a deaf person with a hearing impairment.

> My Deafness has multiple meanings. It is a source of empowerment and pride, and a source of scorn. My Deafness is primarily due to the social barriers I encounter every day. Those caused by prejudice toward and discrimination against deaf people, not just due to my inability to perceive sounds. Nonetheless, I have never considered having cochlear implants because I do not believe that these issues can be solved by implants. Instead, social experiences have taught me how to deal with these issues and how to survive in a hearing-majority world.

> After learning sign language, I accepted my identity as a Deaf person who uses a visual language, not one with a deficit in hearing, and decided to move to the United States for postgraduate studies. I believed that I could learn English through vision, without listening and speaking training. As Charles Dickens wrote, “it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” Learning sign language has positively influenced my life and self-esteem—my season of light. My Deafness is not based on how much I can’t hear or perceive sounds, but on how well and how clearly I can or cannot communicate with hearing individuals in a meaningful way. I believe that Deafness can be eliminated when all deaf individuals have equal opportunity to access information, public education, and public services, as hearing individuals do every day. (Chongmin Lee)

## Deaf culture here at USU
The biggest way to connect with Deaf culture here at USU is probably through the ASL club. Additionally, you can most likely learn about Deaf events through ASL club.
If you wanted to learn more about Deaf culture or ASL here at USU a great way would be to take some of the ASL courses offered here.
