Hey Signing Aggies!
Did you know that 10 years ago some Deaf USU students sued the university?
It's true! A group of current and past Deaf USU students decided to band together and create a lawsuit against the university on the grounds of there not being enough interpreters or note takers for their classes.
The outcome of the court case was decided about a year later, and the Deaf students won! More interpreters were hired by the university, and the students were promised to be informed on the status of the interpreters for events.

This goes to show that Deaf students are capable of making change in the world they live in!
