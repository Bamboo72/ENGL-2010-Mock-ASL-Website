Signing Aggies!
Don't miss out on the fun ASL Club happenings this October!

RSVPs for the murder mystery party are due tonight at midnight! This is a super fun activity to maximize your signing and sleuthing skills. It will be held on October 28th at 7:00 pm with a $3.00 entry fee. Further details about location and characters will be sent out the Monday before the event.

On top of that, our ASL Club t-shirt design competition is still ongoing! This design will rest on the chests of our Signing Aggies around campus, and we want you to have full creative control. Remember, the winner receives their shirt for free as well as a gift card, so get your signing friends together and brainstorm some ideas! Submissions close on October 18th at midnight.

Happy Halloween!
Signing off,

The ASL Club
