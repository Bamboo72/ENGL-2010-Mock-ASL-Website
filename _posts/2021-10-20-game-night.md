Signing Aggies!
Hopefully, you are all staying warm out there in this fall weather!

We wanted to invite you all to a cozy evening of ASL, games, and camaraderie this Wednesday, Oct 20th @ 7:00 pm in the Lillywhite building. Feel free to bring snacks to share or some friends to enjoy an evening of signing together.

This week we will also be announcing our new ASL Club officers, so keep an eye out for some exciting news!

See you all Wednesday!

Signing off,

The ASL Club
Megan â˜… Camilla
