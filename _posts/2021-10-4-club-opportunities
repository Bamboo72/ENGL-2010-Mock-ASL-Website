Signing Aggies!
There are some exciting new opportunities in the ASL Club this week that you won't want to miss out on!

First of all, the ASL Club is looking for some bright-eyed and bushy-tailed new officers to run club activities going forward. This is a really cool opportunity to get creative, gain some leadership skills, and improve your ASL! There are several open officer positions, so we promise you will find something you like.

Don't miss out on this cool opportunity! Applications close next Monday, Oct 11.

In addition to leadership opportunities, we also are excited to announce our first-ever ASL Club t-shirt design contest!

The ASL Club needs new merch, so get your creative juices running and submit your ideas now. The winning design will be printed on this year's USU ASL Club t-shirt and worn across campus. The winning designer will receive their t-shirt for free as well as a free gift card!

Get your friends involved and have fun mixing ASL and art! Design submissions will close in two weeks on Oct 18th.

Let us know if you have any questions, and we'll see you all very soon at our next activity!

Signing off,

The ASL Club
