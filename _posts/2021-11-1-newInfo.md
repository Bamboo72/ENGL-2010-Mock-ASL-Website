Hey everyone!
Be sure to check out the new "[Learn About Deaf Culture](https://bamboo72.github.io/ENGL-2010-Mock-ASL-Website/learn_more/)" tab on the website!
It's got information about what Deaf Culture is, how you can interact with it more, the issue of cochlear implants, and what Deaf culture is like here at USU.
It's always good to learn more about Deaf people and their culture, and how we all can be more connected.

If you have a request about more info you want to see here on our website, please [contact us](https://bamboo72.github.io/ENGL-2010-Mock-ASL-Website/contact/)!
