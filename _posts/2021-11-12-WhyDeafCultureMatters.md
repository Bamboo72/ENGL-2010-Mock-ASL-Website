When talking about the topic of Deaf culture the question of "Why does it matter?" is often brought up. This post aims to give some answers to that question.
1. Inclusion
Deaf culture provides a place of belonging to people that are deaf or hard of hearing. The people within the Deaf community are always very friendly and inclusive to anyone who wants to be involved.
This is in contrast to the hearing world where it can be very difficult to find a place of belonging, especially for those of marginalized groups and cultures. Deaf culture provides a place of refuge for those who have nowhere else.
The friendship and inclusion offered by Deaf culture is very important.

2. A Unique Perspective
People within the Deaf community have a unique perspecive of the world. Knowing how people can get by without the sense of hearing can increase appreciation for the other senses and bring awareness of how our societies are organized.
Aside from a unique sensory viewpoint, the Deaf experience is typically a difficult one, and yet they are usually positive and optimistic. Thus, seeing the world from the perspective of Deaf culture shares the strength of it's individuals.

3. It's Fun!
As stated before, Deaf people are usually very friendly. Interacting with them shows how fun they are! Going to ASL or Deaf events is typically a great time because of the inclusive and welcoming atmosphere.
If you need an example of how fun Deaf culture can be, just come to an ASL club event! Everyone is welcome, and it's always a great time. ðŸ˜„
