Hey everyone!
I'm the ASL Club Vice President, Jacob Schwartz, and I recently conducted a poll to investigate awareness of ASL on the USU campus.

To conduct my poll, I initially tried to put up posters around campus with a QR code leading to the poll questions, but that ended up... unsuccessful. Turns out only official USU events get to go up on the bulletin boards!
I adapted my plan, however, and was able to send out the poll in three places over social media: the USU subreddit, a survey subreddit, and my own Instagram story.
Through this method I was able to get something to compare the USU results to.

You can see the results in a spreadsheet through these links:
* [USU Reddit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d4jbxXYkqkgNbxNelpL5EOmeSIyf_jG0RKIiGEly-cA/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Survey Taking Reddit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yBTQsCkQdKaHUKJ2-Uk2dKr05VnrC18CDQ_kbT4Pxog/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Instagram](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vB0XoHEw_ZT2Nn-aRuaXLlOhNujCKrorxqdi4fcmyiU/edit?usp=sharing)

Analyzing my results, I believe the survey was a little bit biased. It seems that the people that took the survey were mostly people who already had a connection to ASL or Deaf culture already.
The majority of people in each version of the poll said they knew at least a few signs, but I suppose that is to be expected since people can pick up a few ASL signs just naturally over time.
The two reddit polls had a much smaller percentage of people say that they knew a moderate or large amount of signs, which signifies that most people weren't super knowlegeable of ASL.

Additionally, the majority of people in the reddit polls said that they didn't know any Deaf people, but surprisingly they did know that Deaf people have a culture (or perhaps they were able to infer that from the question)
In the USU reddit poll the majority of people said that they didn't know we had an ASL club here at USU, but that is to be expected since the ASL club isn't a USUSA club and the offical website is outdated.

Overall, I think this poll could've gone better (with the sample size and amount of biased results), but I think there is some interesting data to come from it.
Keep on the lookout for a future post about a revised poll I might make in the future!

Signing off ;)
   Jacob Schwartz, Vice President
