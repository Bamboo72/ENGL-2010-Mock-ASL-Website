Hey everyone!
We hope you're having a great summer!
We had an idea to excercise your ASL skills and get a fresh new perspective on the world we live in. It's called the "Going Deaf" project!
Here's how it goes:
1. Find a pair of noise blocking earplugs or headphones
2. Make a name tag explaining that for a project you can't hear or talk
3. Go out into public and try interacting with people!

A few suggestions:
* Bring friends! Whether they know ASL and also want to "go Deaf", or if they don't know much about Deaf people at all, it can be a fun experience for everyone.
* Pick a fun place to go! Some ideas are the mall, a carnival, a restraunt, or a party. Don't let feeling out of your comfort zone stop you from having a great experience with this project!
* Think of how you're going to communicate with people before hand. A notepad? An interpreter?

We'd love to hear how what your experience was! Feel free to [contact us](https://bamboo72.github.io/ENGL-2010-Mock-ASL-Website/contact/)!

Goodluck with "going Deaf", and have a great rest of your summer!
